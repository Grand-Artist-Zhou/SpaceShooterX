Please run this game in landscape mode.

We have tested this game on several different devices. In rare cases, the game may throw exceptions when it tries to load models from a .scn/.dae files even if the file is physically in the correct position. We had this problem twice, and we believe this is a bug from SceneKit. If you have this problem, please create a new file with the same name in the same position, and copy all the content from the old file to the new one.
